            <h2>Discover The World Of Basketball</h2>
            <p>James Naismith invented basketball in 1891. Naismith was a physical education teacher in Springfield, Massachusetts. 
                His school asked him to create a sport that students could play indoors during the winter. 
                The first basketball game had peach baskets as the goals. That is why the sport was named basketball. 
                The metal hoop was not invented until 1906.
            </p>
            <p>Basketball quickly became popular throughout the United States. 
                Both men and women started playing basketball at the college level in the early 1890s. 
                The first professional basketball league in the United States was formed in 1898. 
                The National Basketball Association (NBA) started in 1949. It is the main professional league in the United States today.

                <h2>Health benefits of playing Basketball</h2>
                <p>Basketball is a contact sport, and it requires a large variety of skill development. 
                    When conditioning for basketball, players need aerobic and anaerobic training. 
                    Aerobic training involves endurance, and anaerobic training involves short burst activities. 
                    During playtime, there is a lot of starting and stopping, so while it is not considered an aerobic sport, it still provides a heart-pumping workout 
                    and promotes cardiovascular health. Because you keep moving, your heart rate increases and also helps build endurance, 
                    which is important to keeping your heart healthy. It will also help lower the risk of stroke and heart disease later in your life.
