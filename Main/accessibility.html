            <h1>Accessibility</h1>
            <p>Using lighthouse we conducted an automated accessibility test to evaluate key aspects such as color contrast and structure.
                The test showed strong compliance with accessibility standards. </p>

            <p>Automated testing is essential but not comprehensive. 
                We conducted a manual review to ensure universal design principles are fully integrated. </p>

                <h2>Responsive design</h2>
                <p>To ensure a responsive design we used a flexible grid layout. 
                    By defining elements are defined in relative units such as percentage, REM and EM, instead of fixed pixels, 
                    we allowed our website to adapt dynamically to varying screen sizes.  </p>
                <p>EM is used for text size relative to the font size of the parent element. 

                    REM is applied to margins and paddings, relative to the root font size,
                    maintaining consistent spacing across the layout. </p>
                <p>To complement the flexible grid layout, we applied CSS rules to make images scale responsively. 
                    This ensures that images adapt to their container's dimensions, whether the screen is large or small. 
                    For example, on a smartphone, an image will shrink to fit the narrower container, while on a desktop, it will expand within its defined maximum size. </p>

        <h2>Code Choices</h2>
        <p>The webpage uses colours with great contrast to ensure the readability and visibility of the content. 
            Poor usage of colour can prohibit users from an effective interaction with the webpage. 
            The text may become cluttered and hard to read, as the text is hard to distinguish from the background. 
            Our design prevents this with an effective usage of dark and light colours, creating great contrast between the webpages contents.   </p>
        <p>The pictures used in the webpage are given an alt text which is an explanation of the contents of the picture. 
            The alt text will be shown if an image fails to display. This was implemented in the code to ensure that the purpose of the picture is communicated. 
            The usage of alt text does also create opportunities for visual impaired users, where the alt text can be used as an description.  </p>
        <p>To enhance interactivity and user experience, we implemented hover effects in our design. Hover functions provides visual feedback when a user interacts with an element, 
            such as a button or a link, using a mouse. This not only improves the usability of the site but also adds an engaging, dynamic element to the user interface. </p>
